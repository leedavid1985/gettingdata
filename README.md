Intro
===========
This repo is for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" class project. 

Raw data
=====
Features (561) are in x_test.txt and activity labels are in y_test.txt. Test subjects can be found in subject_tests.txt. Similarly, you can find training data in the appropriately labeled files. You can can read more about the data at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

Processing
=====
Test and train data were merged; subject and activity labels were also pulled in from separate files. A "tidy" dataset output contains the wide form for the mean and SDs for each variable per subject/activity pair.
